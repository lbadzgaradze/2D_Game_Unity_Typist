The objective of this game is to keep earth safe for as long as possible.
Shapceships are attacking the Earth and you need to type the word associated with each of them to blow them up.
Once you start typing a word, it gets activated (it gets marked red); if you input a wrong letter you get penaltized. If you blow up the spaceship you get points.
As you get more points, game gets harder:
-chances that you will encounter increases.
-speed and quanity also increases incrementally.
-penalty and reward increases incrementally.
